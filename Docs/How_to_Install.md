# How to install `CompareFiles`

1. Copy the contents of the zip file --- except the HTML file you are reading --- to the default folder for Dyalog user-defined User Commands.

   By default that is `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\MyUCMDs`.

2. Rename the file `CompareFiles.ini.template` to `CompareFiles.ini`.

3. Make amendments to the INI file:

   * Check the default comparison tool.
   * Check the installation folders of the tools you might use.

     Consider that some tools are available in both a 32-bit and a 64-bit version.
   * Remove the tools you a certain not to use ever.
